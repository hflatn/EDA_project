__**Q1. What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? **
A1. Do major crimes at or near a subway station impact a subway commuters choice in routes or transportation? 

**Q2. Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?**
A2. The police could use it to gauge the effect a crime has on the neighborhood.
    MTA and services such as Google Maps could more accurately predict commute times.

**Q3. What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?**
A3. MTA turnstile data and NYPD Shooting Incident Data.

**Q4. What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?**
A4. Change in turnstile entries and exits. Any information pertaining to the location and date of the turnstiles and crimes.

**Q5. If modeling, what will you predict as your target?**
A5. The turnstile entries and exits.

**Q6. How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?**
A6. By shaping my data using SQlAlchemy and pandas. Also, by creating graphs using Matplotlib.

**Q7. Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?**
A7. No

**Q8. What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?**
A8. A map showing a change in percentage in each borough/neighborhood/precinct, with a paragraph describing the findings.
